## Description

#### Use the template provided to write your code (Mandatory)

### Some Rules to Follow:

- Before writing a single line of code, please read the problem statement very carefully.


### Problem Statements:

- We are primarily testing CSS, and you need to achieve the results using only CSS. Some of the CSS is provided in the boilerplate. You just need to add the remaining CSS, and comments are provided to help you understand where you need to add the CSS.

## Problem 1 (Card Flip)


Use the following files for coding:
- `index.html` -> HTML file -> There is no need to write any HTML code.
- `index.css` -> CSS file -> You need to work on this file.

1. There is a `div` with `class="card-inner"` that contains two child `div`s.
2. Using CSS, we need to achieve the following functionality using CSS only:
   - By default, only the `div` with `class="card-front"` should be visible. When we hover over the card, it should rotate 180 degrees so that the `div` with `class="card-back"` becomes visible.
   - Again, when we move our cursor away from the card, the `div` with `class="card-front"` should be visible.

## Problem 2 (Button Displacement on Hover)


Use the following files for coding:
- `problem2.html` -> HTML file -> There is no need to write any HTML code.
- `problem2.css` -> CSS file -> You need to work on this file.


1. A button has been created for you. When we hover over that button, it should move away from its position and transform towards the positive x-axis with the transition of 1 second.


### General guidelines

- The system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes for responding,
- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug it before itself
- we also request you not just submit it last minute
- try to keep one submission at a time
